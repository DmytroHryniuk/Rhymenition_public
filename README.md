#### Summary [:arrow_up:](#table-of-contents)
_Rhymenition â€“ application to search for rhymes and subsequently display a definition of the selected word._

How often did you have to find a rhyme and you couldn't come up with one?
We offer a simple solution to all your problems!
Now any of your poems, songs or ballads will sound different and take much less time and effort to write.
The app can rhyme with almost any word.

But, what to do if the found word or rhyme is unknown to you?
All you have to do is click on a word in the list and the application will show you all possible definitions of the found word.
Definitions are organized as a carousel of cards, scroll through them and learn!
As you may have already understood, the application is very easy to use.
Just type in a word, check the rhyme list, read the definitions and choose the one that suits you best!
